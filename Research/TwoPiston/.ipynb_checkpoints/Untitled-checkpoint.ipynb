Turned off edge detection (channel 4) for the scope, reset mode to averaging, then number of averages to 50. After pulling the data, goes into string file. First 6 or 7 characters are garbage. After that, the remainder of strings are data points. After pulling data, scope runs free to clear buffer. Must clear buffer after. Maybe don't need. Restart averaging should clear buffer. Put data where it needs to go. Average it if we need. Save to the data matrices. Move motor, small motions. Move relative to direction 1. Wait to settle vibrations from movement.
