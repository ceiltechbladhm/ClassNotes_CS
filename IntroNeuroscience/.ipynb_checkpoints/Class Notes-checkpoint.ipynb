Conclusion: in the absence of cell-cell signaling, ectodermal cells will adopt a neural fate. If BMP receptors are blocked, the intact cap, the cells become neural. If BMP is added to disociated celld, they become epidermal. Concludsion: Neural induction occurs.\n",

High to low dorsal to ventral gradient of concentration; also low to high raustral to caudal concentration. The concentrations are the highest where the spinal cord meets the brain stem. Because it crosses the membrane, and acts at super low levels of concentration, very powerful; can easily cause mutations. If we add more to a tadpole, we lose more brain structures. What we are doing on top of the onese the embryo is already expressing, we are now spreading out the area which thinks it should become the boundary between the hindbrain and the spinal cord.

These HOX genes are organized occurding to where they are expressed in the embryo. 5' caudal, 3' raustral (distal to proximal). Called the master regulators. Work in combinations. Affected by multile genes. In the hind brain, the rhombecephalon.

Channels: $10^7$ ions/s. Under normal physiological conditions, the concentration gradient of ions remains effectively unchanged. Changes in the electrical gradient of the cell are negligible.  Driving force is essentially constant. Ion flow will largely be determined by conductance. There are lots of different channel types. We can modicy how a channel functions.

Never happens with a channel. Cell units are from a different protien. When we call something $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$, that means the yare different genes making different protiens. N and C refer to the ??? of the protien. All the channels, we need to know the number of protiens to make a functional channel. How they get voltage dependence. What the ion selectivity it is, and whether they have a regulatory subunit. The diagrams come from x-ray crystalographers. Transmembrane domain is the part within the membrane. T1 domain - intracellular. the $\\beta$ subunit. Many subunit genes, therefore many protiens. We could have a heterotetromer (red blue and green could be from different protiens). Subunit and funcitonal protiens are different! Know difference. The $\\beta$ subunit is regulatory. the $\\alpha$ is required. Can make a channel that passes ions using only the $\\alpha$ subunits alone. $\\beta$ can change properties. Voltage gated channel domains are lined with charged aminio acids.

Type we are showing in the book are voltage sensitive. htey only pass K+, but they are Ca+2 gated. It opens the channel so that it then passes K+. If we do the voltage clamp experiments for this channel,it doesn't pass any current at -120. Will pass Ca+2 at 50 mV. Amount of current that passes also depends on the amount of Ca+2. That is still current for K+. This is achieved by altering the conductance.  Or by increasing the number of channels that open. The Ca+2 does this. At 0 mV, we have current because we have conductance from K+ at 0mv. Affected by bothvoltage and Ca+2.\n",
