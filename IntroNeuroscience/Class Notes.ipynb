As they move past, they go inside the embryo and form the germ layers. Ectoderm, mesoderm, endoderm. The organizer secretes molecules. Segreted by the ectoderm. Most of these are protiens. Rhetonoric acid is actually an acid. Must induce genes which express this acid.\n",

They removed the animal cap from a frog blastocyst. It became epidermis (skin). This suggests the default is skin. Then they pulled the cells apart from each other; they then became neural cells. Conclusion: in the absence of cell-cell signaling, ectodermal cells will adopt a neural fate. If BMP receptors are blocked, the intact cap, the cells become neural. If BMP is added to disociated celld, they become epidermal. Concludsion: Neural induction occurs.\n",

It is rarely a comlete faulure to close the tube. Spina bifida is prevented by follic acid (vitamin B9). This is why you use prenatal vitamins. Neural axis divided into three segments.

Also in the ventral side of neural tube (floor plate). This is very permeable. Synthecized in one cell, gets into another cell. Somehow affects gene transcription. High to low dorsal to ventral gradient of concentration; also low to high raustral to caudal concentration. The concentrations are the highest where the spinal cord meets the brain stem. Because it crosses the membrane, and acts at super low levels of concentration, very powerful; can easily cause mutations. If we add more to a tadpole, we lose more brain structures. What we are doing on top of the onese the embryo is already expressing, we are now spreading out the area which thinks it should become the boundary between the hindbrain and the spinal cord.

    "Dont have to memorize the pathways. Something is secreted. They all have roles in the mature organism. Segmentation, refers to segments of our spinal cord. The sementation applies. The HOX genes were discovered. Humans have 4 chromosomes which have this gene. These HOX genes are organized occurding to where they are expressed in the embryo. 5' caudal, 3' raustral (distal to proximal). Called the master regulators. Work in combinations. Affected by multile genes. In the hind brain, the rhombecephalon. Each rhombomere will express a subset of the HOX gene. muatations in a single HOX genes will affect a segment of the spine and the nerves which innovate it. The HOX genes have functions in the mature adult. \n",

HOXC13 mutation can cause weird hair folecule development, and underdevelopment of toe nails. One more notable is the HOXD13 cluster. MOst distal part of the hands, leads to 2 extra digits in hands or toes."
