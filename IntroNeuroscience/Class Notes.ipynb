Conclusion: in the absence of cell-cell signaling, ectodermal cells will adopt a neural fate. If BMP receptors are blocked, the intact cap, the cells become neural. If BMP is added to disociated celld, they become epidermal. Concludsion: Neural induction occurs.\n",

High to low dorsal to ventral gradient of concentration; also low to high raustral to caudal concentration. The concentrations are the highest where the spinal cord meets the brain stem. Because it crosses the membrane, and acts at super low levels of concentration, very powerful; can easily cause mutations. If we add more to a tadpole, we lose more brain structures. What we are doing on top of the onese the embryo is already expressing, we are now spreading out the area which thinks it should become the boundary between the hindbrain and the spinal cord.

These HOX genes are organized occurding to where they are expressed in the embryo. 5' caudal, 3' raustral (distal to proximal). Called the master regulators. Work in combinations. Affected by multile genes. In the hind brain, the rhombecephalon.

The nget action potential, causes depoarization, open the voltage gated Ca+2 channels. Giant one, 24 domains. Ca+2 flows in according to the driving force. It binds to a protein. Binding causes fusion of synaptic vesicle with plasma membrane. Not like synaptic vasicle dissolves into membrane. Some of it stays as if separate entity from plasma membrane. Called exocytosis (other types of exocytsis as well). Because of fusion, anything solulable diffuses out into the synaptic cleft. We then have the neurotransmitter diffusing across the synaptic cleft. Occurs pretty rapidly, also pretty vulnerable. Binds to receptor, causes opening of the channel. Not always binding to channel, but typical. Causes post-synaptic depolarization. If enough depolarization happens, post-synaptic channel depolarizes. The vesicle which has been absorbed by the membrane gets endocytosed. Specialized proteins required, want to keep separate from plasma membrane. Gets recycled into endosome, gets reused to make another vesicle. All this happens very rapidly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Discovered by experiment. Can we follow content of vesicle? Enzyme called the horseradish peroxidase (HRP). Makes dark precipitate when given a substrate. Can follow with microscope. Releases some synaptic vesicle. Some of the stuff gets taken up. Fusion takes ~1 ms. Withing 10 ms, we have endocytosis. Then vesicle reappears and ready again within 1 min. Can exceed synapse ability to release neurotransmitter. Can recycle proteins on surface of vesicle.\n",

    "In more detail. Not memorize names of all proteins, but a few need to be known. Two proceesses known as budding. ectodome into vesicle and endocytosis known as budding. The clatherine on to (protective state). Gets pinched at the base called dynamin. Uncoat the proteins, fuses with endodome. Old proteins broken down. Don't know a lot. Goes to a reserve pool. number of vesicles in a reserve pool varies. High frequency ones have a larger reserve pool Anchor protein called synapsin. In the reserve pool, kept away from plasma membrane. If 2 membranes get close, they want to fuse. To get vesicles in a state that they want to fuse, the vesicles are moved closer in a process called docking. Get set part is called priming. Brount in very close proximity. They Ca+2 enters, binds to synaptictagmin. Back in 2006. SNAP and SNARE proteins, not neural specific, found on vesicle and plasma membrane, and work in conjuction with each other. Synaptobrevin and Synaptotagmin (bind Ca+2), transmembrane proteins. Syntasin, presynaptic transmembrane. SNAP25 - periferal membrane protein, because has hydrophobic domain. \n",

    "Looking at docking and priming. Vesicle approaches membrane. Docks when snaps and snares on one side interact with snaps and snares on the other. Priming, 3 of 4 molecules, physically interact, vesicles now very close to plasma membrane. VG channels open, synapsotagmin undergoes conformational change (one protein now able to interact or stop interacting with another) causes clamping down, brings membrane super close. Causes Neurotransmitter release. \n",
    "\n",
    "Toxins interfere with the snaps and the snares. Why we get neruological problems. Lots of these have unfortunate GI consequences. With these toxins, encounter bacterial toxins. Like botchulinum, anerobic bacteria, found in improperly preserved canned food, affects GI system. Tetnis toxin is anarobic, grows on rusty nails. BotX-a (commercial), cleaves SNAP25. Cut proteins. If you eat it, it will affect GI system. Can't contract. Because cant contract, also cures wrinkles. The effect of tetnus toxin, targets interneurons. Normally inhibit motorneurons from contracting, contract more than they should, gives rigid paralysis.\n",

    "Lots of diseases which affect. Myashtenic (mya means affects muscles). Latrotoxin, from black widow spider, triggers vesicle fusion. Painful because it targets pain neurons in the peripheral nervous system. Botulism and tetanus affect snare involved in vesicle fusion. LEMS disease, attacks CA+2 channels. Targets Ca+2 channels. Don't get vesicle fusion. Look in some detail at the Ach receptor. Called the nicotinic Ach receptor. Binds nicotine, how it was discovered. Ligand gated ion channel. If we do a patch clamp (doesn't have to be voltage), this channel not affected by voltage, based on Ach binding. Different durations of being open. Depends on the on and off kinetics of the ligand (Ach binding). High concnetration of Ach in cleft, channels stay open longer. Since channel, get 2 pA of current. Get maximum of 300000 channels opening.\n",
    "\n",
    "this channel is ligand gated (nAChR). Acetylcholine receptor. Na+ goes in, K+ goes out normally. Passes both. Must look at the net current when more than one goes in. Reversal potential is when there is no NET current through a channel. May be individual currents, but are equal and opposite. Look at equilibrium potential for channels to figure out what's moving through. AT 110 mv, we are moving inward current. at 0 mv, we have no met current (thus is Erev). At 70 mv, large outward current. Ion could be involved. Ek = -100 mv, ENa = +70, Ecl -50 (think). We could have either Cl and Na, or K and Na. Instead, we do the experiment by increasing concentration of K+. We are either increasing or decreasing DF, which should change the reversal potential for the ion. Decrease outside concentration of Na, Erev decreases. This tells use that Na must flow through the channel. If outside K+ is increased, Erev increases. \n",

Erev > Vm, so we get inward current, Cl going out. ONly continue to go out until reach reversal potential, then changes potential. Since it is the only ion, Erev = ECl-.

For a long time, we only regarded this as a way to get a handle on the amount of neurotransmitter in a vesicle. The smallest unit would represent the quantal content. This should be directly proportional to the concentration of neural transmitter. Without changing things presynaptically, we can change the amplitude of the MEPPs. What types of things could change this? Obviously inceasing the amount of neurotransmitter. We can also change the properties of the receptors, such as the number or function of receptors.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we looked at VG receptors, we also saw ligand receptors. Not all ligand recptors are for neurotransmitters. We will eventually see cyclic nucleotide gated channels. Most neurotransmitter ion channels will bind on the outside. Area above would be the synaptic cleft. VG Na+ channel have only one large $\\alpha$ subunit. With VG K+, takes 4 subunits to make a funcitonal channel. Combine them in different ways. The AMPA receptor is a glutamate receptor and is a tertamer, may or may not pass Ca+2. \n",

    "Very important is the idea of the ion pumps and transporters. All these things move ions across their gradient. IN the case of the pumps, it comes from ATP. In case of ion excahngers and co-transporters, it actually comes from the electrochemical gradient. Think of it as a windmill. Pumps will have to bind to molecule on the plamsa side, hydrolisys causes conformational change which allows it to transport ions across the channel. Na/K pump concentrates K on inside and Na on outside. Ion exchangers have ions which move opposite direction. Cotransporters move all ions that move in the same direction. One with gradient, one against. Some go with concentration gradient, some go opposite.\n",

Could be dangerous, run down the gradients, have no action potential.\n",

    "Back to neurotransmitters. Previously discussed proof that neurotransmitters existed. We saw that Ca+2 entering from outside to inside caused release of vesicles. Classically, defined by location, regulation, and function. Locaton, they were in presynaptic vesicles and released. Regulation: the release was dependent on Ca+2. Funciton: they bind post-synaptic receptors. Two major categories of neurotransmitters. Look at simplified cartoon of cell. In the cell body, lots of proteins. Small moleule neurotransmitters are made by enzymes near the synapse. The enzymes themselves are synthesized in the cell body, then transported through axon. Called anterograde transport. Enzymes near synapse must put stuff in vesicles. Post-synaptic density (PSD).Vesicles are small and clear. Most small molecules are syntheseized near synapse and packed into small, clear vesicles. Minority of tansmitters fall in category of peptide neurotrans itters, made from proteins in cytoplasm of soma, go into vesicles, then transported anterogradely to synapse. Near synapse, but not at the active zone. Because of their position\n",

    "Co-transmitters. Voltage gated K+ channels are near active zone. Action potential opens VG Ca+2 channels, Ca+2 interacts with, release NT near active zone. By time Ca+2 diffuses. HF stimulation, Ca+2 channels open longer, Ca+2 diffuses to dense fore vcesicles. Also Ca+2 dependant using synaptotagmin. Need higher stimulation frequency to release peptide transmitter. Gives cell different response to different frequency. Peptide neurotransmitters tend to diffuse, and are a part of paracin singnalling. \n",

    "Partial list of NT. For each of these, types of receptors. 2 Main categories. 1. Ligand-gated ion channel (more comfortable). Ligands bind, ions flow through. NT directly causes ion flow. 2. G-protiend coupled recetpor (GPCR). Not ion channel. Once ligand binds, G protien goes off and activates an \"effective protein\". May or may not lead to opening on ion channels. Very often, will NOT open ion channels. Rather, modulates function, modulates the response to future stimulations.\n",

Activity leads to contraction. All the other neurons are part of a motor circuit. We also need to understand both motor neurons. Most muscles can be controlled by motor neurons, in the ventral horn of the spinal cord. Cell bodies of MN are in the spinal cord. Muscles which control distal are in lateral. Medial portions controls proximal muscles. (Further away mean further from the center for spinal cord). Trunk in main part of body are most medial. Proximal - close to body.\n",

Any neuron which has a NMJ, the dye travels retrogradely through the nerve. It enters the spinal cord. If we analyze the spinal cord and cut it up, we will label it with the dye. Do this for muscles in the bicep, we label a series of neurons within the spinal cord. Al of the motor neurons which control that neuron are part of the motor neuron pool. The example in the book isn't the best. Positioning for two muscles at the back of calf. \n",

One synapse excites gamma neuron, alpha motor neuron. Takes 2 to go from 1a to inter neuron to alpha motor neuron of opposing muscle. Causes contraction of both the flexor and the spindle. Synapse of 1a sensory to the interneuron happens at the same time. Second synapse onto alpha of opposing muscle happens later.\n",

Muscle spindle with anad wihtou the gamma motor neuron. First, look at alpha motor neuron activation without gamma neuron. Extrafusal (without a capsule) stimulation, and look at the intrafusal (capsule) muscle fibers, as the muscle contracts, the 1a stops firing. This is because it is inactive/out of range. It can no longer respond to the stimulus. In a normal muscle, we would lose proprioceptice information from this muscle. Get proprioceptive information involved. The spindle and the 1a sensory cannot sense muscle contraction. Do again, but with the gamma, we see something different. IN this case, 1a response is filled in (doesn't stop firing).

If this muscle contracts, the GTO will be pulled. What we see is that the GTO acts in a negative feedback loop to manitain force. When DRG corresponding to the 1b synapes onto interneurons. One excitatory, one inhibitory. The excitatory neuron will excite the extensor muscle (opposite the one the GTO is attached to), and the inhibitory will inhibit the flexor muscle (one GTO is attached to).

Indirectly regulates muscles (no direct commands). Disruptions in cerebellum causes poor balance, coordination of eyes, cannot adjust your movements.
