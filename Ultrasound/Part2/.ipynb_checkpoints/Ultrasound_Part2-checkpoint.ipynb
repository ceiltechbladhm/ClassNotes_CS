In most materials, it won't have a significant effect; but in some materials, we can order these materials. We can change the order of these molecules from random to ... well ordered. ;) We can orient these molecules such that the dipoles all point in the same directions. This is the basis for the Piezoelectric property. The polarization of the material is nonzero when  there is zero electric field. In a broader class of materials called dielectrics, we still get a nonzero polarization, but it only comes in response to external electric fields. It is only 0 when there is an electric field.
