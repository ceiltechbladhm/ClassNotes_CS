    "\n",
    "When pressure wave comes in, density varies along the coordinate. At wavefront, density is increased. Behind, density is increased. In front of wavefront, no change. Because of the difference in pressure, there is an oscillatory flow of molecules. Thus, one more physical quantity changes: fluid velocity $v$.\n",
