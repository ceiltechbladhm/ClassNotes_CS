    "Photoacoustic imaging. Does anything between acoustic and acoustics. Or detection of acoustic waves using light and lasers. There used to be a sienctific war on the terminology. People felt very strongly about what we should call this topic. Some call it opto-acoustic. What we mean is that we excite ultrasound waves using light. Photoacoustic imaging is not that new. The first time this is introduced was Bell. He wrote about both generating light through sound and visa versa. He thought this would be the way to transmit audio signals. He thought light would be the carrier ofthe information. He would figure out how light would be modulated, then reconstruct an audio wave. This isn't ultrasound (still in audible), and wasn't a great success. However, in th 1970s - 80s, photoacoustics was used in the spectroscopy. IN this, the wavelength of light is varied; traditional imanging looks at the absorption of light. In photoacoustic spectroscopy, the light gets chopped by spinning wheel. The light then hits a sample, creating a photoacoustic effect. There is some sort of thermal expansion. It was used more in the agriculture world (dunno why???).\n",
    "\n",
    "What happens since then?\n",
    "\n",
    "Things were still in the audible range. Then the field evolved mostly due to the availability of pulse laser (ns pulse widths). This created a photoacoustic effect with much higher bandwidth. The same devices can be built with very short pulsed lasers. This is how it began. The wavelength is very short and opens up the possibility to do mulitchannel detection and image reconstruction. In the 90s, the field began to emerge.\n",
    "\n",
    "A sample with the tissue is nonhomogeneous. Some light is absorbed more than the others. The laser pulse is propagated throughout the tissue. The whole tissue is diffusively illuminated with the laser. The laser is not focused; more like diffused behaviour. Temporal behavior still very short. This then creates acoustic stress. due to light absorption. The pressure propagates radially outward as an acoustic wave and hits the detector. If this is due to imaging, we can use this to reconstruct an image. This is not the type of mechanical echo; it is based on the optical tissue. This allows us to see which tissue absorbed the imaging."

    "Let's say we have a small sphere; at some point, it is illuminated by a laser pulse. The pulse is short; within the duration of illumination, the temperature is elevated due to light abosrption. This corresponsds to a rise in pressure. This is because, if you increase the temperature of a material, you get an increase in pressure. There is no time yet for the object to expand. The object stays the same size. No thermal expansion. To have any kind of change in the size of the object, the pressure must be relaxed. The pressure wave is released spherically outward. If we wait long enough, the temperature also returns; however the acoustic wave is generated by the release of pressure.\n",

The temperature elevation is generally less than $1^o$. This causes a change in pressure on the order of 200 Pa. It can even be on the order of 10 Pa, and we can detect it still.

    "Then there is a useful observation, which is that most scattering occurs in cell tissue or organells. The scatterers are very dense in 3D. The situation is more like very short travel to scattering. The difference in optical refraction index is what causes the scattering. The changes are small, so the deflection is small; so what we have are small deflections, but many of them. There is a model which takes the scattering of small angles and maps it to look more like diffusion. The random walk is the equivelant of diffusion; if we look at the probability distribution of random wand and diffusion, they have the same distribution. So what we do is we couple more events to gether (maybe 10), and call them an effective scattering event. So we go from a real scattering coefficient to a normalized scattering coefficient. The average angle $<\\cos\\theta>$ is the average change in angle. Usually this is close to 1; however in the normalized equations, we want the mean to be 0 (to mimic random walk probability distribution). We then create the reduced scattering coefficient.\n",
